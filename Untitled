I prefer the original tagline that was more like "slow down or speed up time on any web page," and I'd rather that be also the README tagline as well. On the website, there's no need for a why above those chips. You have I'd say drop the minimal zip size thing, and same thing, no dependencies. Most people don't seem to care about that kind of thing. I suspect this would be used in tools where that doesn't matter. It's more for tools that are optionally loaded or Chrome extensions.
